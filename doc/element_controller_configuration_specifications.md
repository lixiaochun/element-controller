### Configuration Definitions

  Configurations are classified and defined by their usage. Also, they are distributed into separate files according to the usage.The table below is a list of them.

  |Namae   |Description            |
  |:---------|:---------------|
  |ec_main.conf      |The file which describes the configurations to be imported during the start up of EC Main Module.|


### Rules of Description for Configurations

There are some rules to describe definitions in configuration files with KEY_VALUE method as follows.

|No.  |Rule of Description            |
|:---------|:---------------|
|1|Character Code: UTF-8|
|2|Line Feed Code: LF|
|3|Delimiter between Key and Value: =|
|4|A line feed must be inserted just after each pair of key and value.|
|5|If a line is started with "#", it is a comment line (and will not be imported).|
|6|Half-width space and TAB characters are prohibited to be used (even in front or behind of "=" sign) except in comments.|
|7|Full-width characters (incl. all Japanese characters) are prohibited to be used except in comments.|
|8|Characters "=" and "#" are prohibited to be used in keys and values.|

Description Example (case of `ec_main.conf`)

~~~console
#REST Waiting I/F Address
rest_server_address=0.0.0.0
#REST Waiting Port
Port_number=8080
~~~

### 1. ec_main.conf
